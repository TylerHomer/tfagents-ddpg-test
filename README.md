# tfagents-ddpg-test
Implements TF-Agents' DDPG agent on the Pendulum-v0 environment. The agent learns successfully and the code is able to implement a custom actor network following the official tutorial. Currently, another file is included which attempts to customize the critic network, but it results in a tf-agents error message.
